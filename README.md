Lip-reading-using-python-and-tensorflow

This project aims to perform lip reading using Python and TensorFlow, inspired by the LipNet model developed by Rizki Armando. LipNet leverages deep learning to recognize spoken words based on visual features extracted from video frames of a speakerâ€™s lips. This implementation extends the approach using Python, TensorFlow, and other libraries to create a robust lip-reading model, with the potential for real-world applications in accessibility, silent communication, and security.
